#Mac OS Useful Activities
If you are using MacOS as your development environment this file describes soe useful things you might want to consider

Our recommendation is to upgrade. For more information and upgrade instructions read [this great article](https://itnext.io/upgrading-bash-on-macos-7138bd1066ba)
